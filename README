Welcome to poudriere!
---------------------

poudriere is a tool primarily designed to test package production on
FreeBSD. However, most people will find it useful to bulk build ports
for FreeBSD.

Its goals are to use modern facilities present in FreeBSD (as ZFS,
jails), to be easy to use and to depend only on base.
