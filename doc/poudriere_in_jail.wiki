<h1>Run poudriere in a jail</h1>

/!\ This can only be done on a 9.X or higher host because it needs recent jails
features

  1.  You need to create a jail the usual way, but you have to make sure you
  respect the following needs:

  *  allow.mount
  *  allow.mount.devfs
  *  allow.mount.procfs
  *  allow.mount.nullfs
  *  allow.mount.zfs
  *  allow.raw_sockets
  *  allow.socket_af
  *  allow.sysvipc
  *  enforce_statfs=1

  2. Make sure the jail have at least the 127.0.0.1 address (and ::1 for ipv6)

  3. create the poudriere ZROOTFS:

<verbatim>
# zfs create tank/poudriere
# zfs set jailed=on tank/poudriere
# zfs jail myjail tank/poudriere
</verbatim>

  4. mount anything inside the jail:

<verbatim>
#  jexec -U root zfs mount -a
</varbatim>
