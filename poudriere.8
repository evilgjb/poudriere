.Sh NAME
.Nm poudriere
.Nd bulk package builder and port tester
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm command
.Cm subcommand
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool is used to build package from the FreeBSD ports tree.
It can also be used to test a single port.
.Pp
Its goals are to use modern facilities present in FreeBSD (as ZFS,
jails), to be easy to use and to depend only on base.
.Sh COMMANDS
The first argument to
.Nm
must be a 
.Cm command
from the following list:
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It bulk
This command makes a ready-to-export package tree, and fills it with
binary packages built from a given list of ports.
.It jail
This command gives you control to manage the jails used by
.Nm
to provide building environment (different FreeBSD versions, different
architectures).
.It ports
This command allows you to manage different portstree which will be used
by
.Nm
(create, update and delete portstrees).
.It testport
This command, mainly targeted at FreeBSD ports developers, launches a
test on a given port (useful before submitting/commiting a port).
.El
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
Here are the list of subcommands and associated options supported by
.Nm ,
sorted by
.Cm command
order.
.Ss bulk
.Pp
There is only one subcommand for bulk command.
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl f Ar file
Absolute path to a file which contains the list of ports to build. Ports
must be specified in the form
.Ar category/port
and shell-style comments are allowed.
.El
.Pp
Here are the options associated with the
.Cm bulk
command.
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl k
This flags specifies to keep the previous built binary packages.
.It Fl j Ar name
If given, run the bulk build only on the jail named
.Ar name.
.It Fl p Ar tree
This flag specifies on which ports
.Ar tree
the bulk build will be done.
.El
.\" comment

.Pp
These subcommands are mutually exclusive.

.Pp
Excepted for
.Fl l ,
all these subcommands requires

.Pp
Here are the options associated with the
.Cm jail
command.
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl q
Remove the header when
.Fl l
is the specified mandatory option. Otherwise, it has no effect.
.It Fl j Ar name
Specifies the
.Ar name
of the jail.
.It Fl v Ar version
Specifies which
.Ar version
of FreeBSD we want in jail.
.It Fl a Ar architecture
Specifies which
.Ar architecture
of FreeBSD we want in jail. (Default: same as host)
.It Fl m Ar method
Specifies which
.Ar method
we want to create jail. Specify
.Ar NONE
if you want to use your homemade jail. (Default: FTP)
.It Fl f Ar filesystem
Specifies the
.Ar filesystem
name (${ZPOOL}/jails/filesystem).
.It Fl M Ar mountpoint
Gives an alternative
.Ar mountpoint
when creating jail.
.El

populate them.
.It Fl f Ar filesystem
Specifies the
.Ar filesystem
name (${ZPOOL}/jails/filesystem).

.It Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d
This directory contains
.Ar make.conf
files for your different jails.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example provides a guide on how to use
.Nm
for bulk build packages.
.Ss Prepare infrastructure
First you have to create a jail, which will hold all the building
infrastructure needs.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.2-RELEASE -a amd64 -j 82amd64"
.Pp
A jail will take approximately 3GB of space.
.Pp
Of course you can use another version of FreeBSD, regarless on what
version you are running. amd64 users can choose i386 arch like in this
example:
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.1-RELEASE -a i386 -j 81i386"
.Pp
This command will fetch and install a minimal jail, small (~400MB) so
you can create a lot of them. It will install the jail under the pool
you have chosen, at poudriere/jailname.
.Pp
You also need to have at least one ports tree to build packages from it,
so let us take the default configuration by creating a ports tree.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere ports -c"
.Pp
A ports tree will take approximately 4GB of space.
.Ss Specify a list of ports you want to build
Create a flat text file in which you put the ports you want to see
built by poudriere.
.Pp
.Dl "echo "sysutils/screen" > ~/pkglist"
.Dl "echo "editors/vim" >> ~/pkglist"
.Pp
Any line starting with the hash sign will be treated as a comment.
.Ss Launch the bulk build
Now you can launch the bulk build. You can specify to build for only one
arch/version ; by default it will make the bulk build on all the jails
created by poudriere.
.Dl "poudriere bulk -f ~/pkglist -j 81i386"
.Ss Find your packages
Once the bulk build is over, you can meet your shiny new packages here:
.Pp
.Dl "/usr/local/poudriere_data/packages/bulk-81i386"
.Pp
with 81i386 as the name of the jail.
.\".Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\"The command may fail for one of the following reasons:
.\".Bl -diag
.\".It "example error message"
.\"An example of an error message.
.\".It "another example error message."
.\"Self explanatory.
.\".El
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
command must be used on a recent version of FreeBSD, i.e. a version
which has ZFS >= v15, and a zpool.
