.Sh NAME
.Nm poudriere
.Nd bulk package builder and port tester
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm command
.Cm subcommand
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool is used to build package from the FreeBSD ports tree.
It can also be used to test a single port.
.Pp
Its goals are to use modern facilities present in FreeBSD (as ZFS,
jails), to be easy to use and to depend only on base.
.Sh COMMANDS
The first argument to
.Nm
must be a 
.Cm command
from the following list:
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It bulk
This command makes a ready-to-export package tree, and fills it with
binary packages built from a given list of ports.
.It jail
This command gives you control to manage the jails used by
.Nm
to provide building environment (different FreeBSD versions, different
architectures).
.It ports
This command allows you to manage different portstree which will be used
by
.Nm
(create, update and delete portstrees).
.It testport
This command, mainly targeted at FreeBSD ports developers, launches a
test on a given port (useful before submitting/commiting a port).
.El
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
Here are the list of subcommands and associated options supported by
.Nm ,
sorted by

order.
.Ss bulk
.Pp
There is only one subcommand for bulk command.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss bulk build of binary packages
This first example provides a guide on how to use
.Nm
for bulk build packages.
.Pp
.Bq Prepare infrastructure
.Pp
First you have to create a jail, which will hold all the building
infrastructure needs.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.2-RELEASE -a amd64 -j 82amd64"
.Pp
A jail will take approximately 3GB of space.
.Pp
Of course you can use another version of FreeBSD, regarless on what
version you are running. amd64 users can choose i386 arch like in this
example:
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.1-RELEASE -a i386 -j 81i386"
.Pp
This command will fetch and install a minimal jail, small (~400MB) so
you can create a lot of them. It will install the jail under the pool
you have chosen, at poudriere/jailname.
.Pp
You also need to have at least one ports tree to build packages from it,
so let us take the default configuration by creating a ports tree.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere ports -c"
.Pp
A ports tree will take approximately 4GB of space.
.Pp
.Bq Specify a list of ports you want to build
.Pp
Create a flat text file in which you put the ports you want to see
built by poudriere.
.Pp
.Dl "echo "sysutils/screen" > ~/pkglist"
.Dl "echo "editors/vim" >> ~/pkglist"
.Pp
Any line starting with the hash sign will be treated as a comment.
.Pp
.Bq Launch the bulk build
.Pp
Now you can launch the bulk build. You can specify to build for only one
arch/version ; by default it will make the bulk build on all the jails
created by poudriere.
.Dl "poudriere bulk -f ~/pkglist -j 81i386"
.Pp
.Bq Find your packages
.Pp
Once the bulk build is over, you can meet your shiny new packages here:
.Pp
.Dl "/usr/local/poudriere_data/packages/bulk-81i386"
.Pp
with 81i386 as the name of the jail.
.Ss test a single port
This second example show how to use
.Nm
for a single port.
.Pp
Let's take the example of building a single port;
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere testport -d ~/ports-cvs/mybeautifulporttotest"
.Pp
all the tests will be done in all the jails in alphabetical order.
.Pp
It starts the jail, then mount the ports tree (nullfs), then mounts the
package dir (pourdriere_data/packages/jailname), then it mounts the
~/ports-cvs/mybeautifulporttotest (nullfs) it builds all the dependency
(except runtime ones) and log it to
poudriere_data/logs/mybeautifulporttotest-jailname-depends.log).
.Pp
If packages for the dependencies already exists it will use them
.Pp
When all the dependencies are built, packages for them are created so
that next time it will be faster.
.Pp
All the dependency phase is done with PREFIX == LOCALBASE.
.Pp
After that it will build the port itself with LOCALBASE != PREFIX
and log the build to
poudriere_data/logs/mybeautifulporttotest-jailname-build.log
.Pp
It will try to:
install it,
create a package from it,
deinstall it,
check for cruft left behind and
propose the line to add to pkg-plist if needed.
.Pp
It is very easy to extend it so that we can easily add other tests if
wanted.
.\".Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\"The command may fail for one of the following reasons:
.\".Bl -diag
.\".It "example error message"
.\"An example of an error message.
.\".It "another example error message."
.\"Self explanatory.
.\".El
.Sh CUSTOMISATION
For bulk building, you can customize binary packages produced by
.Nm
by changing build options port by port, and you can also specify
building directives in a make.conf file.
.Ss Custom build options
Before building a package,
.Nm
can mount a directory containing option files if available.
.Nm
will check for any of these directories in this order:
.Pp
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jail-name>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options
.Pp
If a directory with this name exists, it is null-mounted into the
/var/db/ports/ directory of the jail, thus allowing to build package
with custom OPTIONS.
.Pp
This directory has the usual layout for options: it contains one directory per
port (the name of the port) containing an 'options' file with lines similar to:
.Pp
.Dl WITH_FOO=true
.Dl WITHOUT_BAR=true
.Pp
As a starter, you may want to copy an existing /var/db/ports/ to
/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options.
.Ss Create optional make.conf
You can also specify a global make.conf which will be used for all the
jails, and also add a per-jail make.conf:
.Pp
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/make.conf
.Pp
and
.Pp
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-make.conf
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
command must be used on a recent version of FreeBSD, i.e. a version
which has ZFS >= v15, and a zpool.
.Sh CAVEATS
.Ss Jailname
.Fl j
is the name of the jail which will also be the name of the zfs
filesystem.
.Pp
Be careful to respects the names supported by jail(8):
.Pp
.Bd
    "This is an arbitrary string that identifies a jail (except it
     may not contain a '.')"
.Pp
Be also careful to not begin the name of the jail by a number if you are
not in -stable or current:
.Pp
